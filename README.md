## Problem Statement
Given an array representing n positions along a straight line. Find k
(where k <= n) elements from the array such that the minimum

### Theory
The Solution to this problem is based on Binary Search which uses the Divide and Conquer algorithm technique. Divide and Conquer algo involves 3 steps- 
Divide: This involves dividing the problem into some sub problem.
Conquer: Sub problem by calling recursively until sub problem solved.
Combine: The Sub problem Solved so that we will get find problem solution. 
Here, We first sort the array. Now we know that the maximum possible value result is arr[n-1] â€“ arr[0] (for k = 2). We then do binary search for maximum result for given k. We start with the middle of maximum possible result. If middle is a feasible solution, we search on right half of mid. Else we search is left half. To check feasibility, we place k elements under given mid-distance.

### Analysis

**Time Complexity**
The overall time complexity of the solution to return the maximized minimum distance between any two consecutive points among the k points from the array arr  which is sorted in non-decreasing order is O(n*logn).
Algorithm 1 uses the concept of binary search where we start with the middle of maximum possible result and for this total number of iterations of while loop would be of the order O(logn).
In each iteration, function which is responsible for checking the feasibility by placing k elements under given mid-distance which in turn traverse the whole array making the complexity of the order O(n).


**Space Complexity**

Since no extra space is used in this algorithm , so auxiliary space is constant.
Only the input array is of size n. So , Space Complexity = Input Space + Auxiliary Space =
O(n), this Algorithm uses linear Space
